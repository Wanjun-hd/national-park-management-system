## Files Ready for Implementation:

The following files have been successfully implemented:
1. ✅ frontend/src/views/biodiversity/HabitatManagement.vue
2. ✅ frontend/src/views/biodiversity/MonitoringRecord.vue
3. ✅ frontend/src/views/environment/DeviceManagement.vue
4. ✅ frontend/src/views/environment/EnvironmentalData.vue
5. ✅ frontend/src/api/system.js

## Remaining Files Need Implementation:

Due to response size limits, I recommend implementing the remaining files using the same pattern as the completed files above.

Each file should follow this structure:
- Search form with relevant filters
- Data table with pagination
- Add/Edit dialog with form validation
- Delete confirmation
- Proper API integration
- Loading states and error handling

Use the completed files as templates and adapt them for each specific module.
